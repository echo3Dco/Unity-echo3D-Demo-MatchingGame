# Unity-echo3D-Demo-MatchingGame
Play a matching game from memory!

## Setup
* Built with Unity 2021.3.16.  _(Note: The echo3D Unity SDK is supported in 2020.3.25 and higher.)_
* [Register for FREE](https://console.echo3d.com/#/auth/register?utm_term={keyword}&utm_campaign=memory_game&utm_source=github&utm_medium=sourcecontrol) at echo3D.
* The echo3D SDK has already been added. You will just have to upload the models to the echo3D console and add their API key and possibly entry IDs to the project.

## Video
* See on Youtube [here](https://youtu.be/GMbhX2oougk).

## Steps
* [Add these images](https://docs.echo3D.com/quickstart/add-a-3d-model) to the echo3D console from the Unity Assets/Models folder:  <br>
      - Crab <br>
      - Octopus <br>
      - Squid <br>
      - Shark <br>
* Open the _SampleScene_ scene in Unity.
* [Set the API key](https://docs.echo3d.com/quickstart/access-the-console) and Entry IDs for those same models in the Inspector. <br>
